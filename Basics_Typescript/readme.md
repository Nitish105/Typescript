# Typescript
TypeScript is javascript with syntax for types.

## What is Typescript ?
Typescript is a programming language that is a superset of JavaScript. It was developed by Microsoft to enhance the development experience of JavaScript by adding static types. This feature helps in catching errors during the compilation phase itself, making the code more robust and maintainable. Typescript also provides other features like classes, interfaces, and modules which help in structuring large codebases and writing reusable code.

Typescript is commonly used in front-end development with frameworks like Angular and React, as well as in back-end development with Node.js. It allows developers to write scalable and maintainable code by providing a type system and other advanced features, while still compiling down to plain JavaScript that can run in any browser or JavaScript environment.
